# OWL: Online Wildlife Laboratory
Project by GABA team.

Pictures are in `data/pics/`.

## TODO
* ability to build geojson from map and store it into database to represent a species' geo distribution
* modals to edit followed relationships
* prefilling addfollowed page after having added a species (with the info of the species just added)
* make carousel dynamic (e.g. random data from random followed or species)
* possibility to merge two species or delete one (in case of input error by a researcher)
* ability to send an alert to all researchers (e.g. "Lynx rufus wanted in such lab")
