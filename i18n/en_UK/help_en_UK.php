This site has been conceived to help wildlife researchers to sahre their data.
Only members of our laboratories are allowed to input data regarding a species,
an individual or even a place where individuals may be. To be able to complete
the database, researchers have to sign in on <a href="login.php">this page</a>.

$feature_p2 = <<<PP2
<p>&emsp;
Our site is designed to be as practical as possible; but it does not have to be
boring! That's why we tried to keep an entertaining aspect, for people who
just want to learn things about the animals we have. Not logged people may
consult data, but can't modify it. For instance they are able to make extensive
researches on Drongos born the last decade. If this is your case, you should start
looking <a href="recherche.php">this way</a>. Or you can wander about and
learn what falls under your sight.
