Since 1987, PyrHQ lab studies animals. Our researchers have always needed to
exchange data with other research facilities. It required a lot of time to
fetch the right researcher with the right data.
</p>
<p>
&emsp;
We are here to provide them the silver bullet tool to ease the exchange of
data and to make those data accessible easily in the most efficient way
via an elaborate and thought GUI. Only identified researchers can add, delete
or edit data, but anyone can access it. You may, for instance, see all
individuals of the species <a href='species.php?id=15'>Caracal</a>, or discover
that the mean weight of our lions is 203kg.
